<h1>Validation Framework</h1>

<h2><span style="color:#00008B">1. Introduction</span></h2>

<p>The validation framework provides guidance on how teams and governance bodies can
verify that fairness has been implemented effectively, proportionately, and in
line with regulatory and organisational expectations. Validation in this
playbook does not focus solely on model performance; it evaluates whether
fairness controls, governance decisions, and accountability mechanisms are
functioning as intended across the AI system lifecycle.</p>

<p>This framework is not intended to be exhaustive or prescriptive. It provides a
baseline that organisations can adapt and extend to reflect their operating
context, regulatory exposure, and risk appetite.</p>

<p>The validation framework aims to ensure that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Fairness risks have been identified, assessed, and documented appropriately.</li>
  <li>Controls and mitigations are proportionate to inherent system risk.</li>
  <li>Governance decisions are justified, traceable, and reviewable.</li>
  <li>Monitoring mechanisms detect emerging risks over time.</li>
  <li>Evidence is sufficient to support internal assurance and external scrutiny.</li>
</ul>

<p>Effective validation indicates that fairness objectives have been implemented in
a way that is compatible with business goals, operational constraints, and
regulatory obligations. Validation therefore supports both technical assurance
and governance assurance, enabling organisations to deploy AI systems with
confidence and accountability.</p>

<h2><span style="color:#00008B">2. Validation Scope</span></h2>

<p>Validation applies across five complementary dimensions:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Risk classification validity</strong>: confirming that the Total Risk Score (TRS) and resulting risk tier accurately
  reflect the system’s inherent risk.</li>

  <li><strong>Control effectiveness</strong>: verifying that fairness, oversight, and robustness controls operate as designed
  and reduce residual risk.</li>

  <li><strong>Governance process integrity</strong>: ensuring that governance gates, reviews, and escalation mechanisms are applied
  consistently and at the appropriate organisational level.</li>

  <li><strong>Documentation completeness and quality</strong>: checking that required artefacts are produced, versioned, and internally
  consistent.</li>

  <li><strong>Operational monitoring and responsiveness</strong>: assessing whether monitoring signals, alerts, and review cycles function in
  practice and lead to timely action.</li>
</ol>

<h2><span style="color:#00008B">3. Validation Activities by Lifecycle Stage</span></h2>

<p>Validation is performed iteratively, rather than as a one-off exercise.</p>

<h2><span style="color:#00008B">4. Validation Methods</span></h2>

<p>The framework supports multiple validation methods, which may be combined based
on system risk.</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Technical validation:</strong> data quality and provenance, model performance and fairness metrics, robustness testing, monitoring outputs, and drift detection.</li>
  <li><strong>Access and control validation:</strong> verification that system access, record access, and audit evidence are role-based, proportionate to risk tier, and enforced in line with separation-of-duties requirements.</li>
  <li><strong>Process and integration validation:</strong> verification that governance and delivery workflows operate as designed, including risk escalation, approval gates, monitoring-to-change-control hand-offs, and revalidation triggers following material change or detected drift.</li>
  <li><strong>Artefact validation:</strong> checks for completeness, version control, and internal consistency of documentation.</li>
  <li><strong>Decision validation:</strong> review of Decision Rationale Logs to ensure trade-offs are explicit and justified.</li>
  <li><strong>Competence and training validation:</strong> confirmation that individuals involved in the development, operation, and oversight of the AI system have received role-appropriate training, with training records maintained where required.</li>
  <li><strong>Supplier and dependency validation:</strong> proportionate assessment of external suppliers, models, datasets, or services supporting the AI system, including review of supplier assurances and documentation, and escalation where participation or evidence is insufficient.</li>
  <li><strong>Independent challenge:</strong> peer review or external assessment for high- and critical-risk systems.</li>
</ol>

<h2><span style="color:#00008B">5. Validation Evidence</span></h2>

<p>Validation relies on existing delivery and governance artefacts rather than the
creation of additional documentation. The objective is to demonstrate effective
implementation and control through evidence that is already generated as part of
normal engineering, governance, and operational workflows.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Dataset Cards, Functional Design Requirements, User Requirements</li>
  <li>Model Cards and Fairness Assessment Records</li>
  <li>DPIA Annexes and impact summaries</li>
  <li>Governance sign-off records such as Risk Assessments, Change Control, Configuration logs</li>
  <li>Monitoring dashboards and alerts</li>
  <li>Audit trail and evidence register entries</li>
  <li>Change logs and version control</li>
</ul>

<p>Evidence requirements scale with risk tier, in line with the Regulatory
Compliance Guide. Periodic reviews form part of ongoing validation and are conducted at a frequency proportionate to system risk, with findings feeding change control and revalidation where required.</p>

<h2><span style="color:#00008B">6. Roles and Accountability in Validation</span></h2>

<p>Validation responsibilities align with the accountability model defined in the
Organisational Integration Toolkit.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Delivery teams validate technical implementation and produce evidence.</li>
  <li>Fairness and Responsible AI leads review fairness methodology and findings.</li>
  <li>Product and domain leadership validate business and domain appropriateness.</li>
  <li>Legal, risk, and compliance functions validate regulatory readiness.</li>
  <li>Governance bodies approve residual risk for high- and critical-risk systems.</li>
</ul>

<p>No system may progress beyond its applicable governance gate without validation
appropriate to its risk tier.</p>

<h2><span style="color:#00008B">7. Validation Outcomes</span></h2>

<p>Validation activities result in one or more of the following outcomes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Confirmation that the system may proceed to the next lifecycle stage.</li>
  <li>Identification of remediation actions prior to approval.</li>
  <li>Escalation to a higher governance forum.</li>
  <li>Temporary suspension or rollback pending mitigation.</li>
  <li>Documented acceptance of residual risk at the appropriate level.</li>
</ul>

<p>All outcomes must be recorded and traceable through the audit trail.</p>

<h2><span style="color:#00008B">8. Continuous Validation and Reassessment</span></h2>

<p>Validation is an ongoing process. Re-validation is required when:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Material model or data changes occur</li>
  <li>System scope or population changes</li>
  <li>Monitoring indicates emerging or unexpected impacts</li>
  <li>Regulatory or organisational risk thresholds change</li>
</ul>

<p>This ensures that fairness assurance remains aligned with real-world system
behaviour over time.</p>

<h2><span style="color:#00008B">9. Using the Validation Framework</span></h2>

<p>Teams should use this framework as a readiness guide rather than a post-hoc audit
tool. By integrating validation into delivery and governance workflows,
organisations can demonstrate that fairness is actively managed rather than
retrospectively justified.</p>
